	<h2>Introduction for parents</h2>
	<p>
		Kawakawa occupations is a blend of experiences and science content. In this term, one of the occupations on offer is compost. In this unit, the students will experience working with a compost pile and working with the wider Kawakawa community to create and maintain good composting habits. They will also explore the scientific ideas of decomposition and interdependence in an ecosystem, and performing experiments to test the best methods of composting.
	</p>
	<h2>Introduction for students</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to the compost occupation! This page has information about what you'll do during this occupation and what you can expect. This is a shorter occupation, only two weeks long rather than the usual four weeks. Each day, you’ll do at least one writing task and at least one physical task. This is to give you variety over the long work cycles. Instead of one big project at the end of the unit, you'll do two smaller projects, one at the end of each week.
	</p>
	<p>
		 At the end of each lesson, I’ll ask you for your reflections on how the day went. I value this feedback in order to adapt the occupation to be the best it can be. (I sometimes change the unit partway through based on your feedback). Near the end of the unit, I’ll sit down with each of you individually for 20 minutes as an ‘exit interview’. This is a chance for you and I to talk about how the occupation went for you.
