	<h2>Introduction for parents</h2>
	<p>
		The level 2 maths course extends what the students learnt in level 1 and prepares them for studying level 3 statistics and/or level 3 calculus. The students start by revisiting inference from level 1. Then they look at several functions (parabolas, exponential and logarithmic functions, etc.) with the graphs standard (2.2).
	</p>
	<p>
		In term 2, they begin their first external, algebra (2.6). Their second external is calculus (2.7). Both of these prepare the students to study level 3 calculus next year.
	</p>
	<p>
		In term 3, the students continue with the calculus external then begin work on their third external, probability (2.12). This prepares the students to study level 3 statistics next year.
	</p>
	<p>
		Term 4 is dedicated to revision.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 21 credits available in this course, 40% internal and 60% external. The course is split into 40% statistics (2.9, 2.12) and 60% calculus (2.2, 2.6, 2.7).
	</p>
	<h3>Homework</h3>
	<p>
		The students are expected to do around 30 minutes of homework for each day they have class. The level 2 students have class on Friday during humanities cycles and on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday (twice) during occupations cycles so they are expected to do either one or three lots of 30 minutes sometime during the week. It doesn't necessarily have to be the same day as class to allow for other commitments.
