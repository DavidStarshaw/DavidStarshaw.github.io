		I am a third-year maths teacher at a small high school, W&#257; Ora Montessori School in Naenae, Lower Hutt. The maths map is a resource jointly made by Stuart Mason, Bruce Menzies, Ewan Orr, and myself (David Starshaw). We developed the maths map with our students in mind but we offer it for use and distribution among other teachers and students according to the creative commons license at the bottom of the page.	I can be contacted at david@waora.school.nz, say hi.
	</p>
	<h2>Why a creative commons license?</h2>
	<p>
		While the maths map was developed for W&#257; Ora Montessori School, it's possible other teachers and students might find it a useful resource. We wanted to make it available without losing control of it. We want others to be free to use any or all of the maths map as it is or as a starting point for developing their own resources, hence derivatives are allowed. However, we don't want any part of the maths map to be sold, even as part of a derivative work, so the license is also non-commercial, share-alike.
