	<h2>Introduction for parents</h2>
	<p>
		The level 3 calculus course expands on the calculus learning that the students have done in levels 1 and 2. The course is dominated by the two big externals: differentiation and integration. The students start term 1 by looking at systems of simultaneous equations in three dimensions with 3.15. For the rest of term 1, the students explore trigonometry, especially modelling using trigonometric graphs, in 3.3.
	</p>
	<p>
		In term 2, the students tackle the first big external: differentiation (3.6). It is the study of motion and change and is used everywhere from planetary motion to stock markets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Term 3 brings the other big external, integration (3.7). It is the reverse of differentiation and is used everywhere that differentiation is used plus a few bonus areas such as areas between curves.
	</p>
	<p>
		Term 4 is dedicated to revision.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 19 credits available in this course, 33% internal and 67% external.
	</p>
	<h3>Homework</h3>
	<p>
		The students are expected to do around 30 minutes of homework for each day they have class. The level 3 calculus students have class on Thursday during humanities cycles and on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during occupations cycles so they are expected to do either one or four lots of 30 minutes sometime during the week. It doesn't necessarily have to be the same day as class to allow for other commitments.
