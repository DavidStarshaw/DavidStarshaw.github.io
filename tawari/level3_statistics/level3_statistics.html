<h2>Introduction for parents</h2>
	<p>
		The level 3 statistics course expands on the statistics learning that the students have done in levels 1 and 2. The course begins with the two statistical investigations: formal inference and bivariate data, both internally assessed. Inference (3.10) means 'to infer' or to make an educated guess. Students will be making formal inferences by using the process of bootstrapping, a very powerful process in statistics. Bivariate data (3.9) asks the students to describe the relationship between two variables and to rigourously analyse the data.
	</p>
	<p>
		Term 2 begins with a short two-week internal, critical path analysis (3.4). It requires students to find the critical path in a network and to analyse it. This standard is not statistics per se, instead it is a part of maths called operations research; the study of making better decisions. The rest of term 2 is spent on the first external standard: evaluating statistical reports (3.12). Students are given texts that make claims based on statistics, e.g. <a href=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/well-good/teach-me/71941774/Working-9-5-is-bad-for-you-study-shows target=_blank>"Working 9-5 is bad for you, study shows"</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In term 3, the students explore their second external, probability concepts (3.13). Probability can be thought of as the opposite to statistics as you have full knowledge about the population and want to know about what a sample of the population is likely to look like.
	</p>
	<p>
		Term 4 is dedicated to revision.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 18 credits available in this course, 55% internal and 45% external.
	</p>
	<h3>Homework</h3>
	<p>
		The students are expected to do around 30 minutes of homework for each day they have class. The level 3 statistics students have class on Thursday during humanities cycles and on Monday, Thursday, and Friday during occupations cycles so they are expected to do either one or three lots of 30 minutes sometime during the week. It doesn't necessarily have to be the same day as class to allow for other commitments.
