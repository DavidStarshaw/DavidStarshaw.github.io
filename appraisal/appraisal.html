				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>I greet my students as they enter the class and ask them how they are. I sometimes ask how their other subjects are going and what they're working on. In my advisory group, I have been <a href="2017/1.1.pdf" target="_blank">going through their past reports</a> and getting them to highlight 7 good things their teachers said about them that they agree with and 1-2 suggestions for improvement that they'd like to work on.</li>
					<li>I seek feedback from my colleagues and students about my practice. Here is the <a href="2017/1.2.pdf" target="_blank">feedback</a> I received on the maths quiz that I organise for the start of each science class.</li>
					<li>I have worked with ICAFS and our SENCO regarding one of my advisory students. This is a <a href="2017/1.3.pdf" target="_blank">description</a> of the role of an advisory (AKA pastoral) teacher</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>PTC 2</h2>
				<h3>Demonstrate commitment to promote the well-being of all &#257;konga</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>take all reasonable steps to provide and maintain a teaching  and learning environment that is physically, socially, culturally and emotionally safe.</li>
					<li>acknowledge and respect the languages, heritages and cultures of all &#257;konga</li>
					<li>comply with relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>At W&#257; Ora Montessori School, we use a restorative process when dealing with conflict. We support students to identify harm that’s done to them and to empathise with harm that’s done to others. I have facilitated restorative conversations between students in many situations. Often requiring no more than a few minutes but sometimes a longer, more robust process is required. Whenever we talk about reparation needing to be made, we always frame it in terms of the harm done.</li>
					<li>I am in contact with the families of my pastoral students when something extraordinarily positive happens or when there’s an issue. If the parents have anything they want to pass on or have a concern, they can contact me and I follow it up for them. I keep a log of every conversation I have with my advisees or their parents so that I can refer to it in the future. It's currently 10 pages long.</li>
					<li>I have been supporting one of my advisees who has been off school all term to work from home by liasing with his subject teachers, him, and his family so that he can still be as much of the community as he can without physically being here which will help his reintergration next year.</li>

				<h2>PTC 3</h2>
				<h3>Demonstrate commitment to bicultural partnership in Aotearoa New Zealand</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Demonstrate respect for the heritages, languages and cultures of both partners to the Treaty of Waitangi</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>We begin and finish each day with a <a href="2017/3.1.pdf" target="_blank">karakia</a>. A few years before I started at Wā Ora, the Te Reo teacher at that time wrote a karakia for our junior high students (Kawakawa) to finish the day with. The words were never written down but passed on by the students through the years. Over time, the words and pronunciation changed. I worked with our current Te Reo teacher to restore the words and pronunciations to what she thought the original was. They are now written down and the karakia is said properly at the end of each day.</li>
					<li>At the start of each year, the junior high students (Kawakawa) go on a two week camp called an odyssey. There are three odysseys that rotate so that in three years, a student has done all three camps. Each odyssey has a tangata whenua component including a noho marae as well as learning about the history of the place and its people. The first odyssey is being in Waitangi for Waitangi day, then following the journey of Te Rauparaha through Tongariro, and eventually to Porirua. The second odyssey looks at historical and modern mining of coal, gold and pounamu. We stay at Arahura marae and learn the history of Ngāti Waewae and pounamu. The third odyssey is based in the Marlborough Sounds and looks at conservation of coastal resources and the seas.</li>

					<li>identify professional learning goals in consultation with colleagues</li>
					<li>participate responsively in professional learning opportunities within the learning community</li>
					<li>initiate learning opportunities to advance personal professional knowledge and skills</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>I was a part of writing the open letter that over 100 teachers of level 1 maths signed and sent to the Ministry of Education and NZQA regarding the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11946050" target="_blank">2017 level 1 maths exams</a>.</li>
					<li>I attended the following professional development this year:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="2017/4.1.pdf" target="_blank">4/4/17 Unpacking the NCEA statistics standards</a></li>
							<li><a href="2017/4.2.pdf" target="_blank">17/5/17 NZQA clarification of 1.2 MCAT and 1.3 tables, equations, and graphs</a></li>

				<h3>Show leadership that contributes to effective teaching and learning</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>actively contribute to the professional learning community</li>
					<li>undertake areas of responsibility effectively</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>I am in charge of maths as a curriculum area in the high school. As part of this I coordinate the four senior classes (level 1 maths, level 2 maths, level 3 statistics, and level 3 calculus) as well as a year 11 maths club that I started this year. I also coordinate the year 8, 9, and 10 classes and the maths quiz that the juniors do each week. Finally, I manage the PAT maths tests which we administer twice each year.</li>
					<li>I am the facilitator for my professional learning group which involves meeting with the principal and the other PLG facilitators each month to discuss our professional inquiries. I help the staff in my PLG with their inquiries and appraisal documentation</li>
					<li>My PLG is organising the end of year concert for the school and I have been leading that with support from the rest of my PLG</li>
					<li>I take a lead role in maintaining the IT systems around the high school and setting up the reports every second term.</li>
					<li>I was a part of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SxD1SKSuJMCj0_T94DAE2eSzYLF9RpVeGOwGa7-UuY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">open letter</a> that a group of maths teachers sent to NZQA and MOE regarding the 2017 level 1 maths exams.</li>

				<h2>PTC 6</h2>
				<h3>Conceptualise, plan and implement and appropriate learning programme</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>articulate clearly the aims of their teaching, give sound professional reasons for adopting these aims, and implement them in their practice</li>
					<li>through their planning and teaching, demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of relevant content, disciplines and curriculum documents</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>I wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10SDiJDAqsEVYcAunYx9ITbtDBVc6Njb4HpajZt7QQn4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">year plan</a> for each of my classes: year 8/9 maths, year 10 maths, level 1 maths, level 2 maths, level 3 calculus, and level 3 statistics</li>
					<li>I wrote several workbooks for my senior classes for them to use during the teaching and learning of that unit. Some of them are:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="6.1.pdf" target="_blank">1.1 Number</a></li>
							<li><a href="6.2.pdf" target="_blank">2.9 Inference</a></li>
							<li><a href="6.3.pdf" target="_blank">3.6 Differentiation</a></li>

				<h2>PTC 7</h2>
				<h3>Promote a collaborative, inclusive and supportive learning environment</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>demonstrate effective management of the learning setting which incorporates successful strategies to engage and motivate ākonga</li>
					<li>foster trust, respect and cooperation with and among ākonga</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>We have long work cycles at Wā Ora Montessori School. Classes can be as long as three hours. I need to be aware of how my class is, including their energy, focus, and engagement. I use strategies like splitting the lesson into very different parts (e.g. active vs. screen time). I also explicitly teach students to take responsibility for their needs, if they are ‘fading’ then I expect them to step out of the class for 5 or 10 minutes to walk around and clear their heads (though not during a teaching time).</li>
					<li>Once a fortnight we have a ‘seminar’ time when the class meets in groups of about 16 students to discuss a text or series of texts that they have read during the week outside of class for about 45 minutes. There are <a href="7.1.pdf" target="_blank">grace and courtesy rules</a> surrounding seminar to facilitate adult-like conversation and to maintain inclusivity.</li>
					<li>Each staff meeting, we have a time of ‘pastoral issues’ where we talk about the issues in the classroom at the moment. This ensures all teachers have at least some knowledge of all of the dynamics that we are aware of and what needs to happen to maintain the health of the community.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="col-9 standard" id='PTC8'>
				<h2>PTC 8</h2>
				<h3>Demonstrate in practice their knowledge and understanding of how ākonga learn</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>enable ākonga to make connections between their prior experiences and learning and their current learning activities</li>
					<li>provide opportunities for ākonga to engage with, practise and apply new learning to different contexts</li>
					<li>encourage ākonga to take responsibility for their own learning and behaviour</li>
					<li>assist ākonga to think critically about information and ideas and to reflect on their learning</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Because I oversee the maths programme from years 8 to 13, I have a good understanding of what students should know and what they often don't know as they come in to each class. I can use this understanding to make connections and build upon it.</li>
					<li>If a student isn't meeting my expectations of them by not bringing equipment to class or not completing work, I start by meeting with them, then their advisor, and sometimes even their parents to assist the student to take responsibility for their own learning</li>
					<li>Our restorative process is a valuable process to help students take responsibility for their behaviour. As an advisor, I am heavily involved in this process.</li>
				</ol>

					<li>select teaching approaches, resources, technologies and learning and assessment activities that are inclusive and effective for diverse ākonga</li>
					<li>modify teaching approaches to address the needs of individuals and groups of ākonga</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>We have a lot of dyslexic students at our school so I decided to make workbooks for my senior students rather than getting them to write all of the notes out each year. I also consider how I use the whiteboard and use multiple colours to differentiate between sections</li>
					<li>In the past I have made <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/waora.school.nz/kawakawa-maths/home" target="_blank">videos</a> to support my students but have found them to be ineffective.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="col-9 standard" id='PTC10'>
				<h2>PTC 10</h2>
				<h3>Work effectively within the bicultural context of Aotearoa New Zealand</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>practise and develop the relevant use of te reo Māori me ngā tikanga-a iwi in context</li>
					<li>specifically and effectively address the educational aspirations of ākonga Māori, displaying high expectations for their learning</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>

				<h2>PTC 11</h2>
				<h3>Analyse and appropriately use information which has been gathered formally and informally</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>analyse assessment information to identify progress and ongoing learning needs of ākonga</li>
					<li>use assessment information to give regular and ongoing feedback to guide and support further learning</li>
					<li>analyse assessment information to reflect on and evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching</li>
					<li>communicate assessment and achievement information to relevant members of the learning community</li>
					<li>foster involvement of whānau in the collection and use of information about the learning of ākonga</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Each week the year 8-10 students do a multiplication quiz testing their basic facts. I gather this data and use it to monitor the ability of our new students and how they progress throughout the years.</li>
					<li>At the end of each term, we either have parent-teacher interviews or reports. I write a comment for each of my students and give an overall teacher judgement for my year 8-10 maths students as to which level of the curriculum they're working at.</li>
					<li>I gather the data from the maths PAT tests to track our students' progress and to determine which test they will sit next. I also use this in reporting for my students.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="col-9 standard" id='PTC12'>
				<h2>PTC 12</h2>
				<h3>Use critical inquiry and problem-solving effectively in their professional practice</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>systematically and critically engage with evidence and professional literature to reflect on and refine practice</li>
					<li>respond professionally to feedback from other members of the learning community</li>
					<li>critically examine their own beliefs, including cultural beliefs, and how they impact on their professional practice and the achievement of ākonga</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>2017 evidence</h4>
				<ol>
					
					<li>I did a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1kx9jUs7yqIbg9mkxCL_W-UIgM5yG-ytVeJg3CBaJI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">self-reflection</a> as part of my professional learning group about the students I am particularly observing and my strengths and weaknesses as a teacher.</li>
					<li>I engage with the feedback I receive from the NZQA moderators regarding our maths internal assessments.</li>
