========== Welcome to the Kawakawa Maths Map! ==========


The DVD-ROM of resources: how should you start?

Open the "Kawakawa Maths Map" document (it is an html 
document that should open in your browser), OR use the 
paper copy. The map document has links to all the 
resources in the other folders on the disc.

The code at the beginning of each box?

The code, for example 23L4, is a reference used to 
relate the Maths Map to the passport.  The first part 
of the code (eg: 23) is the row down the Maths Map and 
the second part (eg: L4) is the level from the 
New Zealand Curriculum.


The text in the boxes? 

The text at the top of each box is a description of
the requirements of the New Zealand Curriculum in each 
topic at each curriculum Level.  


How do you work at the right level?

Kawakawa akonga will be at different levels, and the 
expectation is that each will take responsibility for 
finding the right level at which to begin work, with 
guidance from the teachers. The New Zealand Curriculum 
documents align Yr8-Yr9 with Level 4 and Yr10 with Level 5.


"Text"?

"Maths is Fun" is an online resource that explains ideas 
and has interactive content. 


"Video"?

Video links lead to the Khan Academy, to videos produced 
by the Maths Centre, and to clips from Dara Ó Briain's 
School of Hard Sums television series, which sets practical
maths problems and shows how they can be solved. All the 
videos are included on this disc, so internet access is
not necessary to view them.


"Worksheets"?
The worksheets are available in class as paper copies,
and in pdf format on the disc. The second page of each 
worksheet shows model answers. If an akonga is finding
a worksheet easy, then it is probably time to try the
last two problems on that sheet then move on to something 
harder. If a worksheet it too difficult, then it might 
be helpful to try some work from the previous level.  
Please ask a teacher if you aren't sure how to use the 
worksheets.


"Extension" ("Ext")?

The word extension (or ext) indicates that the linked 
resource deals with related material that goes beyond
the requirements of the curriculum at that level, but
may be of interest to some akonga.


How can you prove you can do it?

The teachers will show you how you can prove you can do 
a section of the work. 


What can you do to help the teachers?

Firstly, take as much responsibility as you can for your 
path in maths. Be really well organised.  Request lessons 
and tutorials. The maths teachers will ask for feedback 
on whether this way of doing maths works for you, and for 
the class, so please remember to tell us what is good, 
and what could be better.  If you find a different resource 
that has really helped you with maths, then please tell 
us about it so we can share it with the class.
